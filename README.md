# Deferred-Payment-Plan
Repository for my final year project.

The project aims to create an inclusive BNPL platform that prioritizes financial well-being through educational features, promoting better spending habits and financial literacy. The focus on transparency, integrity and user-centered design empowers users to make informed decisions about their spending and avoid accumulating debt - an application that supports every lifestyle.
